Subject: [PATCH] ws2_32: Do not fail in closesocket for unknown socket.

This makes cygwin64's rsync happy. It seems to fork a child process
of itself which wants to close sockets derived from the parent process.

Kind of related Wine-Bug: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54995

rsync -aq --delete-before dir-a dir-b
  rsync: [Receiver] Failed to dup/close: Socket operation on non-socket (108)
  rsync error: error in IPC code (code 14) at pipe.c(157) [Receiver=3.2.7]
  rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
